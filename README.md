# tembleke
Simple script written in C++ that when it is executed, the mouse pointer moves lighthly above the screen.

I have made this script in order to prank my friends in ICT (information and communication technology) class.
To execute it you just need to double click the tembleke.exe file.
> I have also added the tembleke.cpp file just in case you do not trust me and want to check out the code or compile it by yourself
